# Hello, World!

My name is Andrei, but you can call me Zaha or Zahatikoff, or whatever else you
want to, nice to meet you.

I am a relatively fresh university dropout of our "wonderful"
[Technical University of Moldova](https://utm.md/en),but I hope to come 
back for my diploma eventually .
My major was Software Engineering, and the fact i only dropped out in year 4
maybe means I am not a total failure.

## The Programming Languages I Use

Here they are, weakly sorted by the time i spend with them

 1. C/C++ - Work, mostly C. I'm also pretty bad with modern C++.
 2. Elixir - My passion language. Love it for the approach to concurrency.
 Processes and supervision trees make so much sense to me, now i only need to 
 apply it in a proper project
 3. Lua - My passion language \#2, Love it for the simplicity and the power
 that can be achieved through it.
 4. Go  - Kinda used for some uni prototype things. want to write more of it
 someday, but not now.


## My passions, I guess

- I love languages of all kinds, be it natural spoken languages or programming
languages.<br/>
Maybe someday i will get a second degree in linguistics and do some NLP, but so
far it is nothing more than a dream.
- I love embedded systems, and i want to get better at electronics, especially
analogue electronics. But digital is great too.
- I kinda stream sometimes, so i want to write 


## The things i want to do

1. I am building a twitch/IRC stream bot that i want to use for myself
2. I want to experiment and try to make my own build system that would either
use, or be written completely in LUA with a tad of C/C++ libraries.
3. I want to get into PCB design someday, to make my own keyboard.
4. I want to make a *hardware* serial terminal. Might even put it as my thesis
when i come back to uni.
5. I kinda want some analogue electronics experience so i want to make a
peamp/amp combo for myself, starting with something simple, and then going with
more complex things.

Some of them, however, are nothing but dreams, that i just hope i will be able
to design/code up into reality.
